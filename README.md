## Download and Use
First, I recommend opening a terminal where you downloaded the executable
Then, if you're on Linux, run:
```bash
./khinsider-dl <album_url> <target_dir> <file_type>
```
Or if you're on Windows run:
```bash
./khinsider-dl.exe <album_url> <target_dir> <file_type>
```
`album_url` Ex: [https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/ace-combat-6](https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/ace-combat-6)

`target_dir` Ex: `~/Music`. The location where the album can be placed. Note: a folder for the album will be made in the target location

`file_type` Ex: `mp3` or `flac`
